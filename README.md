# Bank Churn Prediction And Recommendation

The project encompasses a comprehensive workflow focused on various stages of machine learning development and application, specifically tailored for predicting bank customer churn. Here's a detailed outline of the project's scope and functionalities:

## Data Preprocessing and Engineering
The initial stages involve cleaning and preparing the data, followed by engineering features that are crucial for the predictive modeling. This step ensures the data is optimized for analysis.

## Predictive Modeling 
Utilizing advanced machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVM, the project aims to develop robust models that can predict customer churn with high accuracy.

## Clustering for Recommendation 
Alongside predictive modeling, the project employs clustering techniques to segment the customer base into distinct groups. This segmentation helps in tailoring recommendations and strategies specific to different customer profiles, enhancing the effectiveness of interventions.

## Streamlit-Powered Front-End Development for Banks: Leveraging Predictive Modeling to Identify and Mitigate Customer Churn

The project uses Streamlit, a Python-based tool, to create an interactive web application. This front end allows customers to either upload their own CSV files or download and use a sample dataset directly within the application. This is particularly useful for users who want to explore the application's capabilities without initially using their own data.

The Streamlit application provides visualizations such as the percentage of customers likely to churn. These visualizations make the insights accessible and understandable, aiding in decision-making processes.

In addition to churn predictions, the application displays tailored recommendations for each customer segment identified through clustering. This allows businesses to implement targeted strategies to enhance customer retention.
